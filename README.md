### Hi there 👋

<!--
**leal2/leal2** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Image to Text to Speech program, using Python and OpenCV
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and TypeScript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 2 cats and a dog!
